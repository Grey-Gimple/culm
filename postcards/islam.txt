Dear Wilson,
I hope you are doing well, I have made it to Medina and we are going to Mecca in a few days. I am exited to experience Ramadan in Saudi Arabia. I am going to try and follow each of The Five Pillars of Islam. I brought some extra money to give to the poor, though it is a little more than 2.5% of my income. Im going to play a game over the next few fays, the goal is to help as many people with small, but helpful tasks, like carrying bags and paying for small items. Im also exited to pray during fasting, I sure will be hungry but it will be o' so very worth it, as I will be praying to Allah. Over the last two days of being here, I have realized how much Allah has created for mankind, and how much I've taken for granted.
