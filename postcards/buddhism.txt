Dear Isma,
I am worried, I have heard rumors that a visionary saw the King's son, Siddhratha Gautama, and told of him becoming the next king, or is to becomea great religous leader. I have heard that the King does not want his son to become a religous leader and has decided to shut his son inside the palace. We are being told to stay clear of the palace until his son has become too old to become a religous leader. I am not sure why though I do believe it is because he does not want his son to bear witness to the suffering of people, and try to help.
