Hello family,
I have arrived at the Ganges River, it is incredible, the people here are so kind and helpful. I got to see a funeral service and participate in the ritual. I got to sweep the ash into the river. The river is so holy, I feel better standing in it, basking in its light, there is no voice to cry suffering while soaking in the water. I think I even see the blinding light that plagues the dreams of those confused by maya. I saw people brushing their teeth in the River, I decided to also do that. It wasn't as nice as I expected. I later noticed a lot of pollutants in the water. there is a lot of pollution in the area coming from everything from untreated sewage to industrial waste. After that, I left for my hotel and began Puja.
