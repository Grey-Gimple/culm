the camps

Dear family and friends,
I don't think I have very much time, I overheard Nazi guards discussing plans to leave the camps I am being held in. I don't think they will bring us with them when they leave, they were talking about more Jewish people at the new camp. Please for your safety, flee the country, head to England and never come back. I am saddened to know that I will not be able to attend Jacob's Bar mitzvah, I know he is excited to be turning 13 this November. I only hope YHWH brings mercy to the souls of the guards here. I pray everyday that we will be set free, but I can only hope. I miss our old home, even after it got turned into a ghetto by the military. I'm hopeful I can make to Hanukkah, I wont be able to light the candles in the menorrah though.
