st paul conversion experience

he tried stopping the followers of jesus

he was going to the city of damascus to arrest followers of jesus

he saw a bright light flash around him, a voice (jesus) spoke asking "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me" jesus told him to go into the city where he would be told what to do. he was blind.

ananias was told by jesus he should lay his hands on Saul

ananias was hesitant, but later complied, he also baptized Saul, Saul became Paul.

Dear Romans,
I was wrong, I was wrong to persecute Jesus Christ and his followers. I bore witness to the light of God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost. I saw a blinding light, Jesus spoke to me and told me to return to the city where I would be given instructions. I could not see, I was blind. When the disciple Ananias of Damascus laid his hands on me, scales fell from my eyes, and I could see. I believe Jesus Christ is the Messiah, as he was put to death, but I saw him in the flesh. I will not be returning to persecute him or his followers. I was also baptized by Ananias of Damascus and my new name is Paul.
