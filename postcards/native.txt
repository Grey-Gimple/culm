Dear Family,
It's been three weeks at the new school, it hasn't been a very good start but it may get better. I haven't seen Dakota yet, I asked if I could see him. The staff here said I wasn't allowed, to "help with my education" and "to prevent distraction." The food here is terrible, it's like a greasy cold mush, it's gross and I miss the meals you made. I made a few friends here, they said they were from the Haudenosaunee tribe. There seem to be other kids from all around at the school. The sleeping arrangement is weird but they have a lot of kids here so it might be fixed soon once they get more beds.
