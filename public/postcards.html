                        <p>Hello family,</p>
                        <p>I have arrived at the Ganges River, it is incredible, the people here are so kind and helpful. I got to see a funeral service and participate in the ritual. I got to sweep the ash into the river. The river is so holy, I feel better standing in it, basking in its light, there is no voice to cry suffering while soaking in the water. I think I even see the blinding light that plagues the dreams of those confused by maya. I saw people brushing their teeth in the River, I decided to also do that.</p>

                        <p>It wasn't as nice as I expected. I later noticed a lot of pollutants in the water. there is a lot of pollution in the area coming from everything from untreated sewage to industrial waste. After that, I left for my hotel and began Puja.</p>

                        <p>Dear family and friends,</p>
                        <p>I don't think I have very much time, I overheard Nazi guards discussing plans to leave the camps I am being held in. I don't think they will bring us with them when they leave, they were talking about more Jewish people at the new camp. Please for your safety, flee the country, head to England and never come back. I am saddened to know that I will not be able to attend Jacob's Bar mitzvah, I know he is excited to be turning 13 this November. I only hope YHWH brings mercy to the souls of the guards here.</p>

                        <p>I pray everyday that we will be set free, but I can only hope. I miss our old home, even after it got turned into a ghetto by the military. I'm hopeful I can make to Hanukkah, I wont be able to light the candles in the menorrah though.</p>

                        <p>Dear Romans,</p>
                        <p>I was wrong, I was wrong to persecute Jesus Christ and his followers. I bore witness to the light of God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost. I saw a blinding light, Jesus spoke to me and told me to return to the city where I would be given instructions. I could not see, I was blind. When the disciple Ananias of Damascus laid his hands on me, scales fell from my eyes, and I could see. I believe Jesus Christ is the Messiah, as he was put to death, but I saw him in the flesh.</p>

                        <p>Dear Wilson,</p>
                        <p>I hope you are doing well, I have made it to Medina and we are going to Mecca in a few days. I am excited to experience Ramadan in Saudi Arabia. I am going to try and follow each of The Five Pillars of Islam. I brought some extra money to give to the poor, though it is a little more than 2.5% of my income. I'm going to play a game over the next few days, the goal is to help as many people with small, but helpful tasks, like carrying bags and paying for small items. I'm also excited to pray during fasting,</p>

                        <p>I sure will be hungry but it will be o' so very worth it, as I will be praying to Allah. Over the last two days of being here, I have realized how much Allah has created for mankind, and how much I've taken for granted.</p>

                        <p>Dear Isma,</p>
                        <p>I am worried, I have heard rumors that a visionary saw the King's son, Siddhartha Gautama, and told of him becoming the next king, or is to become a great religious leader. I have heard that the King does not want his son to become a religious leader and has decided to shut his son inside the palace. We are being told to stay clear of the palace until his son has become too old to become a religious leader.</p>

                        <p>I am not sure why though I do believe it is because he does not want his son to bear witness to the suffering of people, and try to help.</p>
